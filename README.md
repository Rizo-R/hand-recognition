Final project for CS6670: Computer Vision. A hand recognition tool for self-centered cameras. This tool builds upon Victor Dibia's handtracking tool (https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking), optimizing it for self-oriented camera view. This tool also uses ensembling with Google's MediaPipe Hand Detection.
